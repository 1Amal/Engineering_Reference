<h2>Git Basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> <code>Git clone </code> : is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). 
        Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.
        There are a couple of ways to download the source code, 
        <p>- Clone using SSH: <code>git clone git@github.com:1Amal/python-webapp-https-amaldevelops.pythonanywhere.com.git</code></p> 
        <p>- Clone using HTTPS: <code>git clone git@github.com:1Amal/python-webapp-https-amaldevelops.pythonanywhere.com.git</code></p> 
      </li> 
      
      <li> <code>git status </code>: command gives us all the necessary information about the current branch.</li>
      
      <li> <code>git add</code> : We need to use the git add command to include the changes of a file(s) into our next commit. 
            <p>- To add a single file: <code>git add [filename] </code></p>
            <p>- To add all files in repo at once: <code>git add -A </code></p>
      </li> 
      
      <li> <code> git commit</code>:  is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed.
        We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code.
        <p><code>git commit -m "commit message"</code></p>
      </li>

      <li> <code>git push</code> :After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.
        <p><code>git push [remote][branch-name]</code></p> 
        <p>However, if your branch is newly created, then you also need to upload the branch with the following command:<br>
          <code>git push --set-upstream [remote] [name-of-your-branch]</code> <br>
          alternatively you can also use: <code>git push -u origin [branch_name]</code> </p>
      
      </li>
        
      <li> <code>git pull</code> : command is used to get updates from the remote repo. 
        This command is a combination of git fetch and git merge which means that, when we use git pull, 
        it gets the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and immediately applies the latest changes in your local (git merge).<br>
        <code>git pull [remote]</code>  </li>
        
        <li> <code>git log -- oneline</code> : To see our commit history, first we need to use:
         </li>

      <li> <code>git revert</code> : A safer way that we can undo our commits is by using git revert. 
        We just need to specify the hash code next to our commit that we would like to undo:<br>
          <code>git revert 3321844</code><br>
         The Git revert command will undo the given commit, but will create a new commit without deleting the older one:
         The advantage of using git revert is that it doesn't touch the commit history. This means that you can still see all of the commits in your history, even the reverted ones. 
         Another safety measure here is that everything happens in our local system unless we push them to the remote repo. That's why git revert is safer to use and is the preferred way to undo our commits.
      </li>

      <li> <code>git pull origin main</code> : Update local copy with the remote copy  </li>
    
    
    </ul>
 
<h2>Git Advanced Topics</h2>
<ul>

  <li> <code>git remote update origin --prune</code> : To update the local list of remote branches </li> 

  <li> <code> git branch -a</code> : To show all local and remote branches that (local) Git knows about </li>


  <li> <code>git checkout dev</code> : When you've completed development in your branch and everything works fine, 
       the final step is merging the branch with the parent branch (dev or master). 
       This is done with the git merge command. Git merge basically integrates your feature branch with all of its 
       commits back to the dev (or master) branch. 
       It's important to remember that you first need to be on the specific branch that you want to merge with your feature branch.
       For example, when you want to merge your feature branch into the dev branch. First you should switch to the dev branch:
   </li>

  <li> <code> git fetch</code> : Before merging, you should update your local dev branch </li>

  <li> <code>git merge [branch-name]</code> : Finally, you can merge your feature branch into dev </li>

  <li> <code>git remote -v</code> : Check the fetch and push locations  </li>

  <li> <code>git config --global user.email "email@example.com" </code> : Set an email address in Git. You can use your GitHub-provided noreply email address or any email address. </li>

  <li> <code>git remote set-url origin [updated link url https://........git]</code> : Update renamed repository address  </li>
</ul>

  <h3> Setting up GitHub on a new Linux installation </h3>

  <ol> 
      <li> <code>git config --global user.name "Amal K" </code> : Use this command for adding a user name and confirm that you have set the Git username correctly:
  <br><code>git config user.name</code> </li>

  <li> <code>git config --global user.email "email@example.com"</code> : To set an email address in Git. 
    You can use your GitHub-provided noreply email address or any email address.<br>
  To confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git:<br>
  <code>git config --global user.email</code> </li>

  <li> <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"</code> : Generating a new SSH key, for further information 
    <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent" target="_blank">Visit here</a>
   </li> 

  <li> <code>eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"<br>
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code> : Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
  </li>

  <li> <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code> : Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account 
    <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account" target="_blank">Visit here</a>
  <br>
  Then select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file displayed in the terminal to your clipboard
  In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, click your profile photo, then click Settings. <br>
  Settings icon in the user bar, In the "Access" section of the sidebar, 
  click SSH and GPG keys. Click New SSH key or Add SSH key. These steps should set your new Linux machine with Github
  </li>

</ol>
