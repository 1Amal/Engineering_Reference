    which portion of the address identifies the node. Class A, B, and C networks have default masks,

<h2>The 7 layers of the OSI model</h2>
<a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3239677/the-osi-model-explained-and-how-to-easily-remember-its-7-layers.html" target="_blank">From Network World</a>
<ul>

<li> <b>A</b>ll <b>P</b>eople <b>S</b>eem <b>T</b>o <b>N</b>eed <b>D</b>ata <b>P</b>rocessing : The first letter of each word is the same as the first letter an OSI layer.</li>    
<li> <b>Layer 7 - Application:</b>
    The Application Layer in the OSI model is the layer that is the “closest to the end user”. 
    It receives information directly from users and displays incoming data to the user. 
    Oddly enough, applications themselves do not reside at the application layer. 
    Instead the layer facilitates communication through lower layers in order to establish connections
     with applications at the other end. 
     Web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) TelNet, and FTP, are examples of 
     communications  that rely  on Layer 7.
    </li>

<li><b> Layer 6 - Presentation: </b> The Presentation Layer represents the area that is independent 
    of data representation at the application layer. In general, it represents the preparation or 
    translation of application format to network format, 
    or from network formatting to application format. 
    In other words, the layer “presents” data for the application or the network. 
    A good example of this is encryption and decryption of data for secure transmission; 
    this happens at Layer 6.
</li>

<li><b>Layer 5 - Session: </b>When two computers or other networked devices need to speak with 
    one another, a session needs to be created, and this is done at the Session Layer. 
    Functions at this layer involve setup, coordination (how long should a system wait for a response,
     for example) and termination between the applications at each end of the session.

     <li><b>Layer 4 – Transport: </b>The Transport Layer deals with the coordination of the data 
        transfer between end systems and hosts. How much data to send, at what rate, 
        where it goes, etc. The best known example of the Transport Layer is the Transmission Control 
        Protocol (TCP), which is built on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), commonly known as TCP/IP. TCP and UDP port numbers work at Layer 4, while IP addresses work at Layer 3, the Network Layer.
     </li>

<li><b>Layer 3 - Network : </b>Here at the Network Layer is where you’ll find most of the router 
    functionality that most networking professionals care about and love. 
    In its most basic sense, this layer is responsible for packet forwarding, 
    including routing through different routers. You might know that your Boston computer wants to 
    connect to a server in California, but there are millions of different paths to take. 
    Routers at this layer help do this efficiently.
</li>

<li><b>Layer 2 – Data Link:  </b>The Data Link Layer provides node-to-node data transfer 
    (between two directly connected nodes), and also handles error correction from the physical layer.
     Two sublayers exist here as well--the Media Access Control (MAC) layer and the Logical Link 
     Control (LLC) layer. In the networking world, most switches operate at Layer 2. 
     But it’s not that simple. Some switches also operate at Layer 3 in order to support virtual LANs 
     that may span more than one switch subnet, which requires routing capabilities.
</li>

<li><b>Layer 1 - Physical: </b>At the bottom of our OSI model we have the Physical Layer, 
    which represents the electrical and physical representation of the system. 
    This can include everything from the cable type, radio frequency link (as in a Wi-Fi network), 
    as well as the layout of pins, voltages, and other physical requirements. 
    When a networking problem occurs, many networking pros go right to the physical layer to check 
    that all of the cables are properly connected and that the power plug hasn’t been pulled from the 
    router, switch or computer, for example.
