***** Git *****
When the repo is cloned between Windows and Linux/Unix machines.

Just tell git to ignore filemode change. Here are several ways to do so:

    Config ONLY for current repo:

     git config core.filemode false

    Config globally:

     git config --global core.filemode false

    Add in ~/.gitconfig:

     [core]
          filemode = false




***** Linux *****
sudo lshw : View hardware info
Edit the Laptop Lid close behaviour
sudo gnome-text-editor /etc/systemd/logind.conf
find out the line #HandleLidSwitch=suspend and change it to one of following :

    HandleLidSwitch=lock – lock when lid closed.
    HandleLidSwitch=ignore – do nothing, some laptops will disconnect Wi-Fi.
    HandleLidSwitch=poweroff – shutdown.
    HandleLidSwitch=hibernate – hibernate Ubuntu.
    
    sudo lshw : View hardware info

restart your computer

Fixing the Encrypted drive issues on boot initramfs
When you boot Ubuntu will not mount the encrypted drive as for some reason i.e. /etc/crypttab has been changed
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p3 DecryptedDrive
Enter the correct password and then exit the console
exit
*nvme0n1p3 is the default name for the SSD, change as per the correct device

Once Ubuntu boots up normally (after the encrypted drive is mounted according to the above)
Edit the /etc/crypttab by
sudo nano /etc/crypttab

Also open up Ubuntu Disks manager and look for the LUKS encrypted drive UUID then add to the 
DecryptedDrive UUID=XXXXX none nofail
Then update initramfs as follows
sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
