***** Git *****
When the repo is cloned between Windows and Linux/Unix machines.

Just tell git to ignore filemode change. Here are several ways to do so:

    Config ONLY for current repo:

     git config core.filemode false

    Config globally:

     git config --global core.filemode false

    Add in ~/.gitconfig:

     [core]
          filemode = false
          
          
 Public e-mail address change if you get this error
  ! [remote rejected] main -> main (push declined due to email privacy restrictions)
  
  You can see your personal e-mail address, which is used by default for your commits in Git:

git config --global user.email
Find your GitHub noreply address in your GitHub's Personal Settings → Emails. It's mentioned in the description of the Keep my email address private checkbox. Usually, it starts with a unique identifier, plus your username:

{ID}+{username}@users.noreply.github.com

hange the global user e-mail address setting to be your GitHub noreply address:

git config --global user.email {ID}+{username}@users.noreply.github.com
Reset the author information on your last commit:

git commit --amend --reset-author
If you have multiple commits with your private e-mail address, see this answer.

Now you can push the commit with the noreply e-mail address, and future commits will have the noreply e-mail address as well.

git push

Fixing the Encrypted drive issues on boot initramfs
When you boot Ubuntu will not mount the encrypted drive as for some reason i.e. /etc/crypttab has been changed
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p3 DecryptedDrive
Enter the correct password and then exit the console
exit
*nvme0n1p3 is the default name for the SSD, change as per the correct device

Once Ubuntu boots up normally (after the encrypted drive is mounted according to the above)
Edit the /etc/crypttab by
sudo nano /etc/crypttab

Also open up Ubuntu Disks manager and look for the LUKS encrypted drive UUID then add to the 
DecryptedDrive UUID=XXXXX none nofail
Then update initramfs as follows
sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
