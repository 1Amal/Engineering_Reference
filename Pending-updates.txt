***** FLEXBOX CSS *****

display:flex; : Flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-growing-and-shrinking)

flex-grow : Expects a single number as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”. When we applied flex: 1 to every div inside our container, we were telling every div to grow the same amount. The result of this is that every div ends up the exact same size. If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.

flex-shrink : Similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item. flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. For example, if our 3 divs from above had a width declaration like: width: 100px, and .flex-container was smaller than 300px, our divs would have to shrink to fit.

flex-direction:column; : column puts the main axis vertical (top-to-bottom).

flex-direction: row; : Puts the main axis horizontal (left-to-right)

justify-content: center; : Aligns items across the main axis vertically

align-items: center; : Aligns items across the main axis horizontally

gap: 8px; : Setting gap on a flex container simply adds a specified space between flex items (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-alignment)
