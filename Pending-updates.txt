<h3>Netlify</h3>
<li>
Setting for React Apps so routing is handled correctly as a single page application (SPA)
Netlify: You need to add a _redirects file to the public/ directory of your project. Copy the following to redirect all routes to the index page and let react-router-dom handle the rest. You can read more about this at the Netlify documentation on redirects.
<code>/* /index.html 200</code>
</li>

<h3>Vercel</h3>
<li>
Setting for React Apps so routing is handled correctly as a single page application (SPA)
Vercel: You need to add a vercel.json file at the root of your project and copy the following configuration. Similar to Netlify, this redirects all routes to the index page and lets react-router-dom handle the rest. More information can be found here at the Vercel documentation for SPAs and Vite.

<code>
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}

</code>

</li>

<h3>CloudFlare Pages
</h3>
<li>
Setting for React Apps so routing is handled correctly as a single page application (SPA)
Cloudflare Pages: As of the time of writing, unlike Netlify and Vercel, no additional steps are required as the default behaviour will allow react-router-dom to correctly handle redirects for SPAs
</li>
