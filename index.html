          For software developers it is vital to keep a handy reference source
          which is available quickly, efficiently and from any location. Hence
          it was decided to collate all the information and to upload to GitHub
          so it can be accessed from anywhere, can be easily accessed, can be
          updated quite easily and anyone who needs this data is freely
          available for access.
        </p>

        <h3>Design principles</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Ability access from any location and any device</li>
          <li>Ability to search easily</li>
          <li>Available offline without an internet connection</li>
          <li>
            Can be printed or converted to PDF files easily so keeping a simple

                Fixing the Encrypted drive issues on boot initramfs:
                <p>
                  When you boot Ubuntu will not mount the encrypted drive as for
                  some reason i.e. /etc/crypttab has been changed cryptsetup
                  luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p3 DecryptedDrive Enter the correct
                  password and then exit the console exit *nvme0n1p3 is assumed
                  as the default name for the SSD, change as per the correct
                  device
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once Ubuntu boots up normally (after the encrypted drive is
                  mounted according to the above) Edit the /etc/crypttab by sudo
                  nano /etc/crypttab
                </p>

                <p>
                  Also open up Ubuntu Disks manager and look for the LUKS
                  encrypted drive UUID then add to the DecryptedDrive UUID=XXXXX
                  none nofail Then update initramfs as follows sudo
                  update-initramfs -u -k all
                </p>

                <h3>Git: Basics</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>Git clone </code> : is a command for downloading
                    existing source code from a remote repository (like Github,
                    for example). Git clone basically makes an identical copy of
                    the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it
                    to your computer. There are a couple of ways to download the
                    source code,
                    <p>
                      - Clone using SSH:
                      <code
                        >git clone
                        git@github.com:1Amal/python-webapp-https-amaldevelops.pythonanywhere.com.git</code
                      >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      - Clone using HTTPS:
                      <code
                        >git clone
                        git@github.com:1Amal/python-webapp-https-amaldevelops.pythonanywhere.com.git</code
                      >
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git status </code>: command gives us all the necessary
                    information about the current branch.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git add</code> : We need to use the git add command to
                    include the changes of a file(s) into our next commit.
                    <p>
                      - To add a single file: <code>git add [filename] </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      - To add all files in repo at once:
                      <code>git add -A </code>
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code> git commit</code>: is like setting a checkpoint in
                    the development process which you can go back to later if
                    needed. We also need to write a short message to explain
                    what we have developed or changed in the source code.
                    <p><code>git commit -m "commit message"</code></p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git push</code> :After committing your changes, the
                    next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote
                    server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote
                    repository.
                    <p><code>git push [remote][branch-name]</code></p>
                    <p>
                      However, if your branch is newly created, then you also
                      need to upload the branch with the following command:<br />
                      <code
                        >git push --set-upstream [remote]
                        [name-of-your-branch]</code
                      >
                      <br />
                      alternatively you can also use:
                      <code>git push -u origin [branch_name]</code>
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git pull</code> : command is used to get updates from
                    the remote repo. This command is a combination of git fetch
                    and git merge which means that, when we use git pull, it
                    gets the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and
                    immediately applies the latest changes in your local (git
                    merge).<br />
                    <code>git pull [remote]</code>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git log -- oneline</code> : To see our commit history
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Git can specify which files or parts of your project should
                    be ignored by Git using a .gitignore file. Step 1: touch
                    .gitignore Step 2: # text comment | name All name files,
                    name folders, and files and folders in any name folder |
                    name/ Ending with / specifies the pattern is for a folder.
                    Matches all files and folders in any name folder For more
                    information go to :

                      target="_blank"
                      >Git Ignore</a
                    >

                  <li>
                    <code>git revert</code> : A safer way that we can undo our
                    commits is by using git revert. We just need to specify the
                    hash code next to our commit that we would like to undo:<br />
                    <code>git revert 3321844</code><br />
                    The Git revert command will undo the given commit, but will
                    create a new commit without deleting the older one: The
                    advantage of using git revert is that it doesn't touch the
                    commit history. This means that you can still see all of the
                    commits in your history, even the reverted ones. Another
                    safety measure here is that everything happens in our local
                    system unless we push them to the remote repo. That's why
                    git revert is safer to use and is the preferred way to undo
                    our commits.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git pull origin main</code> : Update local copy with
                    the remote copy
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>git fetch</code> : Use git fetch to retrieve new work
                    done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all
                    the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging
                    those changes into your own branches.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git diff</code> : Show you all of your local changes
                    since you last committed.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git diff index.html</code> : To check what changes
                    made to a certain file simply add the path of a file as an
                    option
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git diff --color-words index.html</code> : this option
                    shows a more concise view
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git diff --staged index.html</code> : Staged changes
                    in a certain file
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git diff --staged</code> : Staged changes in all local
                    files
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git diff main (NAME OF OTHER BRANCH)</code> : It's
                    also possible to compare two branches to each other. This
                    helps you find out how exactly the code in both branches is
                    different:
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git diff main feature/login index.html</code> :
                    Compare a certain file in two different branches. You can do
                    this simply by adding the file's path: This will show you
                    how the file "index.html" was changed in the feature/login
                    branch, compared to how it looks in the main branch.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>git remote update origin --prune</code> : To update
                    the local list of remote branches
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code> git branch -a</code> : To show all local and remote
                    branches that (local) Git knows about
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git checkout dev</code> : When you've completed
                    development in your branch and everything works fine, the
                    final step is merging the branch with the parent branch (dev
                    or master). This is done with the git merge command. Git
                    merge basically integrates your feature branch with all of
                    its commits back to the dev (or master) branch. It's
                    important to remember that you first need to be on the
                    specific branch that you want to merge with your feature
                    branch. For example, when you want to merge your feature
                    branch into the dev branch. First you should switch to the
                    dev branch:
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code> git fetch</code> : Before merging, you should update
                    your local dev branch
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git merge [branch-name]</code> : Finally, you can
                    merge your feature branch into dev
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>git remote -v</code> : Check the fetch and push
                    locations
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code
                      >git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
                    </code>
                    : Set an email address in Git. You can use your
                    GitHub-provided noreply email address or any email address.
                  </li>

                  <h3>JavaScript: Loops</h3>
                  <p>
                    Which loop type should you use? If you're iterating through
                    an array or some other object that supports it, and don't
                    need access to the index position of each item, then
                    for...of is the best choice. It's easier to read and there's
                    less to go wrong. For other uses, for, while, and do...while
                    loops are largely interchangeable. They can all be used to
                    solve the same problems, and which one you use will largely
                    depend on your personal preference — which one you find
                    easiest to remember or most intuitive. We would recommend
                    for, at least to begin with, as it is probably the easiest
                    for remembering everything — the initializer, condition, and
                    final-expression all have to go neatly into the parentheses,
                    so it is easy to see where they are and check that you
                    aren't missing them.

                    item and then use flexbox to arrange its children. Flex is
                    actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and
                    flex-basis.

                  <li>
                    flex-grow : Expects a single number as its value, and that
                    number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”. When we
                    applied flex: 1 to every div inside our container, we were
                    telling every div to grow the same amount. The result of
                    this is that every div ends up the exact same size. If we
                    instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div
                    would grow to 2x the size of the others.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    flex-shrink : Similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink
                    factor” of a flex item. flex-shrink only ends up being
                    applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their
                    parent container. For example, if our 3 divs from above had
                    a width declaration like: width: 100px, and .flex-container
                    was smaller than 300px, our divs would have to shrink to
                    fit.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    flex-basis : Simply sets the initial size of a flex item, so
                    any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that
                    baseline size. The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis:
                    0%. The reason we had to change it to auto in the
                    flex-shrink example is that with the basis set to 0, those
                    items would ignore the item’s width, and everything would
                    shrink evenly. Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to
                    check for a width declaration (width: 250px). Important Note
                    About Flex-Basis: There is a difference between the default
                    value of flex-basis and the way the flex shorthand defines
                    it if no flex-basis is given. The actual default value for
                    flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an
                    element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0. If you want to
                    only adjust an item’s flex-grow you can simply do so
                    directly, without the shorthand. Or you can be more verbose
                    and use the full 3 value shorthand flex: 1 1 auto, which is
                    also equivalent to using flex: auto.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    flex: auto; : Is one of the shorthands of flex. When auto is
                    defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of
                    flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto or to
                    flex: 1 1 auto using the flex shorthand. Note that flex:
                    auto is not the default value when using the flex shorthand
                    despite the name being “auto” which may be slightly
                    confusing at first. You will encounter and learn more about
                    flex: auto and its potential use-cases when reading through
                    the assignment section. In Practice: You will likely not be
                    using complex values for flex-grow, flex-shrink or
                    flex-basis. Generally, you’re most likely to use
                    declarations like flex: 1; to make divs grow evenly and
                    flex-shrink: 0 to keep certain divs from shrinking. It is
                    possible to get fancy, and set up layouts where some columns
                    relate to each other in a specific ratio, so it’s useful to
                    know that you can use other values, but those are relatively
                    rare.

                  <li>
                    flex-direction:column; : column puts the main axis vertical
                    (top-to-bottom).

                  <li>
                    flex-direction: row; : Puts the main axis horizontal
                    (left-to-right), the flex-direction property's default is
                    row.

                  <li>
                    justify-content: center; : Aligns items across the main axis

                  <li>

                  <li>
                    gap: 8px; : Setting gap on a flex container simply adds a
                    specified space between flex items
                    (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-alignment)
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are
                    defined, so when creating a flex container all of the
                    contained flex items will behave in the following way. Items
                    display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is
                    row). The items start from the start edge of the main axis.
                    The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can
                    shrink. The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross
                    axis. The flex-basis property is set to auto. The flex-wrap
                    property is set to nowrap.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    flex-wrap: no-wrap; : Using nowrap would cause an overflow
                    if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink
                    small enough to fit. It is also the initial value.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    flex-wrap: wrap; : As flex-wrap is set to wrap, the items
                    wrap
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    flex-flow : You can combine the two properties
                    flex-direction and flex-wrap into the flex-flow shorthand.
                    The first value specified is flex-direction and the second
                    value is flex-wrap
                  </li>

                <li>
                  Naming Things:Names for functions and variables should be
                  descriptive. Always use camelCase. To keep things consistent
                  and easy to read, variables should always begin with a noun or
                  an adjective (that is, a noun phrase) and functions with a
                  verb. It is ok to use single characters as variable names in
                  the context of a loop or a callback function, but not
                  elsewhere.

                <li>
                  Use Naming Standards for Functions and Variables: Whenever a
                  variable or a function is created, its name should be
                  descriptive enough as to give a general idea of what it does
                  or what it’s for.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid Indiscriminate Mixing of Coding Languages</li>
                <li>
                  Summarize Your Imports: Even though it is much better to have
                  additional coding languages imported from different files,
                  this shouldn’t be abused. If there are too many style sheets,
                  they can probably be summarized into one or two. This won’t
                  only save space and make things look cleaner, but it will also
                  save loading time. Each imported file is an HTTP request that
                  tampers with the performance of your application. So apart
                  from being a consideration for tidiness, it is also a
                  consideration for efficiency.

                  <b>Layer 7 - Application:</b>
                  The Application Layer in the OSI model is the layer that is
                  the “closest to the end user”. It receives information
                  directly from users and displays incoming data to the user.
                  Oddly enough, applications themselves do not reside at the
                  application layer. Instead the layer facilitates communication
                  through lower layers in order to establish connections with
                  applications at the other end. Web browsers (Google Chrome,
                  Firefox, Safari, etc.) TelNet, and FTP, are examples of
                  communications that rely on Layer 7.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b> Layer 6 - Presentation: </b> The Presentation Layer
                  represents the area that is independent of data representation
                  at the application layer. In general, it represents the
                  preparation or translation of application format to network
                  format, or from network formatting to application format. In
                  other words, the layer “presents” data for the application or
                  the network. A good example of this is encryption and
                  decryption of data for secure transmission; this happens at
                  Layer 6.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Layer 5 - Session: </b>When two computers or other
                  networked devices need to speak with one another, a session
                  needs to be created, and this is done at the Session Layer.
                  Functions at this layer involve setup, coordination (how long
                  should a system wait for a response, for example) and
                  termination between the applications at each end of the
                  session.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Layer 4 – Transport: </b>The Transport Layer deals with the
                  coordination of the data transfer between end systems and
                  hosts. How much data to send, at what rate, where it goes,
                  etc. The best known example of the Transport Layer is the
                  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is built on top of
                  the Internet Protocol (IP), commonly known as TCP/IP. TCP and
                  UDP port numbers work at Layer 4, while IP addresses work at
                  Layer 3, the Network Layer.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Layer 3 - Network : </b>Here at the Network Layer is where
                  you’ll find most of the router functionality that most
                  networking professionals care about and love. In its most
                  basic sense, this layer is responsible for packet forwarding,
                  including routing through different routers. You might know
                  that your Boston computer wants to connect to a server in
                  California, but there are millions of different paths to take.
                  Routers at this layer help do this efficiently.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Layer 2 – Data Link: </b>The Data Link Layer provides
                  node-to-node data transfer (between two directly connected
                  nodes), and also handles error correction from the physical
                  layer. Two sublayers exist here as well--the Media Access
                  Control (MAC) layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer.
                  In the networking world, most switches operate at Layer 2. But
                  it’s not that simple. Some switches also operate at Layer 3 in
                  order to support virtual LANs that may span more than one
                  switch subnet, which requires routing capabilities.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Layer 1 - Physical: </b>At the bottom of our OSI model we
                  have the Physical Layer, which represents the electrical and
                  physical representation of the system. This can include
                  everything from the cable type, radio frequency link (as in a
                  Wi-Fi network), as well as the layout of pins, voltages, and
                  other physical requirements. When a networking problem occurs,
                  many networking pros go right to the physical layer to check
                  that all of the cables are properly connected and that the
                  power plug hasn’t been pulled from the router, switch or
                  computer, for example.

              <h3>Python Basics</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Python Indentation: Indentation refers to the spaces at the
                  beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages
                  the indentation in code is for readability only, the
                  indentation in Python is very important. Python uses
                  indentation to indicate a block of code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  # : Add in front of the code for commenting out single line of
                  code
                  <br />
                  """ <br />
                  Use triple quotes for multiline comments <br />
                  """
                </li>

                <li>print("Hello World"): Print a message onto the screen</li>

                <li>
                  Variable: Variables store data types into the memory of your
                  computer, Variable names are case-sensitive. allowing Python
                  to automatically populate them into your code when you
                  reference them later.<br />
                  "Name=Value" <br />
                  On the left side of the variable we give name for the variable
                  = On the right side we assign a value <br />
                  A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more
                  descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). <br />
                  Rules for Python variables:<br />
                  A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore
                  character<br />
                  A variable name cannot start with a number<br />
                  A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
                  underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )<br />
                  Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three
                  different variables)<br />
                  Pascal Case: Each word starts with a capital letter:
                  MyVariableName = "John" <br />
                  Snake Case: Each word is separated by an underscore character:
                  my_variable_name = "John"
                </li>

                <li>
                  Primitive Data Types: Data types that are single objects and
                  are immutable (cannot be changed without being redefined).
                  These are:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Numbers: Numbers (with an optional + or - prefix).</li>
                    <li>
                      Integers: are whole numbers with an optional positive + or
                      negative - prefix. For example, 3, 82, 38218, +3, -71 are
                      all integers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Floats: Any number containing a decimal point is
                      interpreted as a float (e.g., 0.32, .32, 83.7823, 1.00).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Strings: Sequences of characters, always enclosed in
                      quotation marks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Booleans: Also called flags; these can only be True or
                      False.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      None: Represents a null value, or the absence of data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Numerical Operators: programmers perform equations with
                      data by using numerical operators, which include +, -, *,
                      /, //, and %.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Converting Data Types: we use built-in functions like float(),
                  int(), str() to convert a data type. For instance, say our
                  data set stores the number “1” as a string. To convert it to
                  an integer, we would write int('1')
                </li>

                <li>
                  Casting : If you want to specify the data type of a variable,
                  this can be done with casting.<br />
                  x = str(3) # x will be '3' <br />
                  y = int(3) # y will be 3 <br />
                  z = float(3) # z will be 3.0
                </li>

                <li>
                  Get the Type : You can get the data type of a variable with
                  the type() function i.e. <br />
                  x = 5 <br />
                  y = "John"<br />
                  print(type(x)) <br />
                  print(type(y) <br />
                </li>

                <li>
                  Complex Data Types: A data type that can hold more than one
                  object as Lists, Tuples, Set and Dictionaries<br />
                  Lists: Enclosed by square brackets ([]). Mutable (changeable)
                  collections of objects with specific orders. The objects in a
                  list can be any combination of data types and do not have to
                  be unique (elements can be repeated).
                  <ul>
                    <li>len() - tells us thg length of our list.</li>
                    <li>append() - adds an item to the end of a list.</li>
                    <li>pop() - removes an element from a list.</li>
                    <li>
                      index() - asks python to return the value in a given
                      position. Indexing in Python starts from 0 not 1.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Tuples: Enclosed by parentheses (()). Immutable versions of
                  lists. Unlike lists, their elements cannot be removed, added
                  to, or changed.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Set: Enclosed by curly braces ({}). A collection of unordered,
                  unique elements.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Dictionaries: Also enclosed by curly braces, but elements are
                  pairs joined by a colon ({:}). These are sets of key-value
                  pairs. Every element has a key (of any immutable data type),
                  which must be unique, and a value (which can be of any data
                  type and does not need to be unique — multiple keys can have
                  the same value). Dictionaries, like sets, are unordered —
                  their index is the keys, not a list of numbers.
                </li>

                <li>

              <p>
                A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
                You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A
                function can return data as a result.

              <h3>Python: Classes/Objects</h3>
              <p>
                Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost
                everything in Python is an object, with its properties and
                methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint"
                for creating objects.

              <h3>Python: Data structures definition and usage</h3>
              <h3>Python: Collections (Arrays)</h3>
              <p>
                There are four collection data types in the Python programming
                language: List is a collection which is ordered and changeable.
                Allows duplicate members. Lists are used to store multiple items
                in a single variable. Create a List: thislist = ["apple",
                "banana", "cherry"] print(thislist)
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate
                  values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the
                  second item has index [1] etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ordered: When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the
                  items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed
                  at the end of the list.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Note: There are some list methods that will change the order,
                  but in general: the order of the items will not change.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Changeable: The list is changeable, meaning that we can
                  change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been
                  created.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Allow Duplicates: Since lists are indexed, lists can have
                  items with the same value:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Python: Tuples</h3>
              <p>
                Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows
                duplicate members. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a
                single variable. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and
                unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets. Create a
                Tuple: thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
                print(thistuple) tuple Items
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate
                  values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the
                  second item has index [1] etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ordered: When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that
                  the items have a defined order, and that order will not
                  change.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unchangeable: Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot
                  change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Allow Duplicates: Since tuples are indexed, they can have
                  items with the same value:
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Python: Set</h3>
              <p>
                Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and
                unindexed. No duplicate members. Sets are used to store multiple
                items in a single variable. A set is a collection which is
                unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. * Note: Set items are
                unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items. Sets
                are written with curly brackets. Example Create a Set: thisset =
                {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} print(thisset)
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Set Items: Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not
                  allow duplicate values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unordered: Unordered means that the items in a set do not have
                  a defined order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Set items can appear in a different order every time you use
                  them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unchangeable: Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we
                  cannot change the items after the set has been created.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you
                  can remove items and add new items.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Duplicates Not Allowed: Sets cannot have two items with the
                  same value. No duplicate members.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Python: Dictionary</h3>
              <p>
                Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable.
                Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A
                dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do
                not allow duplicates. Dictionaries are written with curly
                brackets, and have keys and values: Example Create and print a
                dictionary: thisdict = { "brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang",
                "year": 1964 } print(thisdict)
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Dictionary Items: Dictionary items are ordered, changeable,
                  and does not allow duplicates. Dictionary items are presented
                  in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key
                  name. v
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ordered or Unordered? :As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries
                  are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are
                  unordered. When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means
                  that the items have a defined order, and that order will not
                  change. Unordered means that the items does not have a defined
                  order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Changeable: Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can
                  change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been
                  created.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Duplicates Not Allowed: Dictionaries cannot have two items
                  with the same key:
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Python: Jupyter Notebook</h3>
              <p>
                Start Jupyter Notebook in any folder, jupyter notebook
                --notebook-dir=”LOCATION of the folder to start Jupyter Notebook
                i.e. D:/Documents”
              </p>
              <p>
                Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab 3.0 For old Jupyter Notebook
                interface installed with notebook package and run as jupyter
                notebook (see the next section for the identical interface
                installed with nbclassic and run with jupyter nbclassic, and for
                JupyterLab):

                </li>
                <li>
                  Replace by c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir =
                  '/the/path/to/home/folder/' Make sure you use forward slashes
                  in your path and use /home/user/ instead of ~/ for your home
                  directory, backslashes could be used if placed in double
                  quotes even if folder name contains spaces as such :
                  "D:\yourUserName\Any Folder\More Folders\"
