    <h2>Purpose of this reference site</h2>

    <p>For software developers it is vital to keep a handy reference source which is available quickly, 
        efficiently and from any location. Before this reference repository was finally hosted on GitHub 
        several methods were used to achieve this goal as follows. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> First iteration was to put reference manuals and important information I found online 
            into a Microsoft Word document and was saved in a folder in the local PC. Problem with this method was it was only available when working on the PC.
        </li>

        <li>To solve this problem they were all uploaded to my Google Drive. 
            Problem with this was updating the reference manuals and data was very cumbersome.
        </li>

        <li> 
            Hence it was decided to collate all the information and to upload to GitHub so it can be accessed from anywhere, can be easily accessed, can be updated quite easily and anyone who needs this data is freely available for access.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design principles</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Ability access from any location and any device</li>
        <li>Ability to search easily</li>
        <li>Available offline without an internet connection</li>
        <li>Can be printed or converted to PDF files easily so keeping a simple and clean interface</li>
        <li>Can be updated easily</li>
        <li>Frequently used Technology information accessible from one place</li>
        <li>Share knowledge and ability for anyone to contribute </li>

    </ul>
